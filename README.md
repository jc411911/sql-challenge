## Employees Database Setup

This README outlines what was done to create and set up the employees database using PostgreSQL, including the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and importing data from CSV files. The employees database was created to analyze employee-related data within an organization.

## Database Design

### ERD Diagram

The ERD diagram was created using the following tables and relationships:

- **Departments**
  - `dept_no` (Primary Key)
  - `dept_name`
- **Titles**
  - `title_id` (Primary Key)
  - `title`
- **Employees**
  - `emp_no` (Primary Key)
  - `emp_title_id` (Foreign Key referencing Titles.title_id)
  - `birth_date`
  - `first_name`
  - `last_name`
  - `sex`
  - `hire_date`
- **Dept_emp**
  - `emp_no` (Foreign Key referencing Employees.emp_no)
  - `dept_no` (Foreign Key referencing Departments.dept_no)
- **Dept_manager**
  - `dept_no` (Foreign Key referencing Departments.dept_no)
  - `emp_no` (Foreign Key referencing Employees.emp_no)
- **Salaries**
  - `emp_no` (Primary Key and Foreign Key referencing Employees.emp_no)
  - `salary`

### Tables and Relationships

The database consists of six tables with the following relationships:

- **Departments** has a one-to-many relationship with **Dept_emp** and **Dept_manager** through `dept_no`.
- **Titles** has a one-to-many relationship with **Employees** through `title_id`.
- **Employees** has a one-to-many relationship with **Dept_emp** and **Dept_manager** through `emp_no`, and a one-to-one relationship with **Salaries** through `emp_no`.

## Database Creation

### Create the Database

- In PgAdmin, create a new database named `employees`.

### Table Creation

- Using SQL in PgAdmin to create the tables.

### Import Data from CSV Files

- Using PgAdminâ€™s import tool to load data into each table from the corresponding CSV files.

## Conclusion

The employees database is set up and populated with data. The ERD provides a visual overview of the database structure, and the tables are ready for queries and analysis.
